The enemies (bugs) will move across the playing area.  Your objective is to move your player using the arrow keys across the playing area to the water without colliding with an enemy.

Functions I plan to add in the future inclde; displaying the score (you can see the score increment if you watch the console), penalize you for colliding with a bug and maybe add some gems to collect.  If I get really ambitious I'll add levels where the enemy speed increases.
